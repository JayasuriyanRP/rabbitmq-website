### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes RabbitMQ is [installed](/docs/download), running on
`localhost` and the [stream plugin](/docs/stream#enabling-plugin)  enabled. 
The [standard stream port](/docs/networking#ports) is 5552. In case you
use a different host, port or credentials, connections settings would require
adjusting.
